/**
 * Wake-on-delivery (v1.5): activate a persisted session that is not
 * currently live, so a tool call never fails just because the target's
 * browser tab is closed.
 *
 * The harness exposes `AgentRegistry.resume()` — load a persisted session
 * and run an agent on it (the same mechanism sub-agents use for cold
 * resume). Delivery paths try it before falling back to queued / offline
 * queueing.
 *
 * Model resolution: a browser-attached session's model is injected by the
 * frontend's model-selection (the `{{model}}` persona variable), which a
 * headless resume does not have — without `agentOptions.provider/model`
 * the first prompt assembly fails. The waker therefore inherits the route
 * from a live session's persisted request header, or uses the configured
 * `wakeProvider` / `wakeModel` fallback. Without either, the wake is
 * refused (the caller falls back to queued / offline queueing).
 *
 * Lifecycle: an activated session STAYS live for the process lifetime. The
 * resume handle is a capability — disposing it would remove the session
 * from the store — so the plugin holds it without ever tearing it down; a
 * restart returns the session to dormant and the next delivery wakes it
 * again. Wake is therefore a process-scoped affordance, exactly like the
 * rate limiter.
 *
