/**
 * Agent Bus for DeepSeek Harness.
 *
 * A host-plane plugin that gives live sessions in the same workspace a way to
 * dispatch work to each other, with a durable ledger recording what was asked
 * and how it turned out. The ledger's lifecycle follows the A2A TaskState
 * vocabulary; the settlement verdict is recorded without changing the state.
 *
 * Two planes, deliberately separate. Delivery is the harness's own: a task
 * becomes one `followup()` on the recipient's inbox, and the driver claims one
 * queued item at a time, running each as its own turn with a durability
 * checkpoint between them. The ledger is this plugin's: it records intent and
 * outcome, and never mirrors the inbox — the inbox is the execution authority
 * and the two drift by design.
 *
 * Authority is derived from durable relationships, never from a stored role.
 * Reachability comes from shared workspace membership; settlement and cancel
 * authority belong to the session recorded as a task's dispatcher. So "PM" is
 * emergent: dispatch work to someone and you are that task's dispatcher, with
 * no role to assign and no way to approve your own work.
 *
 * Installation: `dsh plugin --profile <name> add <this package>`.

const USAGE_TEXT = `You share a workspace with other agent sessions and can dispatch work to them.

ROUTE BY SCOPE — pick the channel that matches how big the ask is:
- SMALL (a message, a question, a confirmation, a one-line coordination ping): send_note. No record, no lifecycle, no acceptance — the peer just answers in prose.
- MEDIUM (one deliverable the peer must produce and you will verify): create_task. Full lifecycle: report → settle → rework/cancel, with timeout backstop.
- LARGE (a multi-step effort that needs planning and ordering): create_flow. FIRST write out the full plan (what must happen, in what order, by whom), THEN create the flow, then split the plan into tasks created with flow_id and dependencies so the DAG auto-schedules: each task delivers only after its predecessors settle, and a failure propagates down the chain automatically. The flow is your roadmap; the DAG view renders it.
Never use a heavier channel than the ask needs, and never a lighter one: chat-as-task is how tasks get stuck forever in working; task-as-chat loses the lifecycle that keeps work accountable.

- list_peers shows the live sessions in your workspace: their names, their self-declared cards, and how busy they are. They are the only valid create_task and send_note targets.
- send_note (SMALL) sends a lightweight note to one peer: a message, a question, a confirmation — anything that is NOT work the peer must deliver a verifiable result for. There is NO task record, NO acceptance, and nothing to report or settle; the peer simply replies in prose, and if it replies it sends a note back to you. When a note you receive carries the <dsh-agent-bus-message> header, treat it as ordinary conversation, not work.
- create_task (MEDIUM) creates one task node for a live peer: work that must produce a verifiable result you will review. The peer works its delivered tasks one at a time, each as its own turn — you do not need to pace dispatches. dependencies names task ids that must settle before this one is delivered: while any predecessor is unsettled the task stays 待投递(queued) and the scheduler delivers it automatically once every dependency settles. acceptance_criteria states the minimum requirement the reviewer settles against. Passing task_id answers a peer's request_input and lets its paused task resume. Passing reviewer names a different session as the one that settles the result; without it you settle it yourself.
- list_tasks with scope=inbox shows the ACTIVE work assigned to you, in the order you will do it. With scope=outbox it shows what you initiated. Archived tasks are invisible by design: a task leaves the listing once it failed, was canceled, or its settlement is more than 24 hours old — history lives in the panel and session logs. Completed tasks awaiting your verdict are still active and carry the worker's report, so read it before settling. Pass status to filter.
- get_task reads one task's full record, including the complete report and question text.
- report_task is the worker's way to finish: a working task becomes completed and the reviewer is notified to settle it. If the task was canceled, report_task attaches your work summary instead.
- settle_task is the reviewer's verdict: success accepts and the task is done; failure sends the SAME task back to the worker for rework with your feedback as the instruction — the task id never changes across attempts, and the worker is notified automatically. The initiator is notified of the final result.
- When you receive a notice that a task you review is completed, settle it promptly; leaving it unsettled stalls the worker.
- When you receive a notice that a task you initiated timed out, decide whether to redo it with a new create_task; a timeout means the worker never finished or never answered.
- cancel_task is the initiator's way to stop a task that is still submitted, working, or awaiting input. The worker is interrupted and asked for a summary, which lands on the canceled task.
- request_input pauses a task you are working on when you need information only the initiator has; they answer with create_task passing task_id.
- update_card maintains your own capability card: a description for other agents and machine-readable capabilities for routing.
- create_flow (LARGE) creates the roadmap container: plan first, then split the plan into tasks created with flow_id and dependencies. A task with unsettled dependencies is created 待投递(queued) — the scheduler delivers it automatically once every dependency settles, and failure propagates down the chain automatically when a dependency fails terminally. edit_task rewrites an undispatched task's requirement, acceptance criteria, dependencies, or flow membership if the DAG turns out wrong. The DAG view renders one flow at a time; flow-less tasks never appear there.
- submit_handoff passes structured context DOWN a chain: when a task you executed settles, deliver each downstream task (one that lists your task in its dependencies) a handoff document — computed values, decisions, caveats. Dispatch concatenates those documents into the downstream task's content, so the next worker reads the chain's state instead of excavating old reports. You may also be the executor of your own task (target yourself) as long as a different session reviews it — nobody approves their own work.

Incoming agent-bus messages open with a header naming the request kind, so read it first:
- <dsh-agent-bus task="…" tool="create_task" sender="…"> — a task to work; do it and call report_task with that task id.
- <dsh-agent-bus task="…" tool="scheduler" sender="…"> — an auto-dispatched task (its dependencies settled); work it like any task.
- <dsh-agent-bus task="…" tool="report_task" …> — a result you review is waiting; settle it promptly.
- <dsh-agent-bus task="…" tool="settle_task" …> — on failure, rework the same task and report again; on success, the task is done.
- <dsh-agent-bus task="…" tool="cancel_task" …> — your task was canceled; report a summary of what you had done.
- <dsh-agent-bus task="…" tool="reminder|timeout" …> — a system notice; it needs no separate action, only your report if you still owe one.
- <dsh-agent-bus-message tool="send_note" sender="…" id="…"> — a chat note, not a task; reply in prose if you wish, nothing to report or settle.
Only the reviewer can settle and only the initiator can cancel, so never mark your own work complete.

Delivery reaches live sessions only. A refusal from create_task is authoritative: the peer is not reachable, not in your workspace, or its queue is full.
